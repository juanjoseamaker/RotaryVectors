# Rotatory vectors

Rotating vectors is a program that allows to create chains of vectors of different magnitude, angle and angular velocity to visualize their evolution over time

## Controls

* Up and down arrows - change magnitude
* Left and right arrows - change angle
* Space - select next vector
* C - create new vector
* D - delete vector
* V and B - change angular velocity (blue vector represents the angular velocity of the selected vector)

## TODO:

* Set angles to exact phi values
* Save and load progress to files
